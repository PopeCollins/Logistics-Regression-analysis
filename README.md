# Logistics-Regression-analysis
I perform a simple logistics regression analysis and display the confusion matrix to see how well my model performs.
Using the make classification function from the Sklearn dataset. I generated a data set of sample size of 200. 
A scatter plot was used the visualize the data to see if the data is a data for logistics regression. 
I split the data into test and train then I fit the x_train on y_train.
Then i predict the model using the test data set and display the confusion matrix.

### CONCLUSION
We can deduce from the confusion matrix that:

True positive: 22 (upper-left) – Number of positives we predicted correctly True negative: 19 (lower-right) – Number of negatives we predicted correctly False positive: 4 (top-right) – Number of positives we predicted wrongly False negative: 5 (lower-left) – Number of negatives we predicted wrongly
